# **_BugReport_**

It is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to report every bug they find in your server.

The bug reports can be seen by the staff or players that has the permission at any moment, 
using an intuitive gui or using commands.

Also, players with permissions can set a priority from one to five to the report, add a label, 
set the report as solved or unsolved, and see when it has been made. It allows you to find reports 
easily, by using filters in the main menu.

In the report, you can see who created it, when was created, the message and the filters.  

Everything is configurable and translatable. You can check the wiki to learn how to do it:

/bug reload

higher by default.
