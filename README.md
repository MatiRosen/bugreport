# BugReport
![Alt Text](https://imgur.com/CywAsRU.jpeg)

BugReport is a plugin for Minecraft servers. It allows players to easily report every bug they find in a server.

All reports can be viewed by staff or players who have the corresponding permission through some intuitives GUIs. Then, the reports can be modified by adding labels, setting a priority or marking as solved or unsolved. It allows you to find reports easier through different filters found in the main menu.

In each report you will be able to see who created it, when was it created, the message of the report, the priority, the labels and the status (solved/unsolved).

Everything is configurable and translatable.
