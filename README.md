# **_BugReport_**

It is a plugin for Minecraft Servers that allow players to easily report all the bugs they find.

The bug reports can be seen by the staff or players that has the permission at any moment, 
using an intuitive gui or using commands.

Also, players with permissions can set a priority from one to five to the report, add a label, 
set the report as solved or unsolved, and see when it has been made. It allows you to search on the Main
Menu with the filters you want.
